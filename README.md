## Goal
A high-performance, purely-functional library for adding instrumentation to any application, with a simple web client and JMX support.

## Introduction and Highlights
ZIO Metrics is a principled functional programming library to measure the behavior of your application. It focuses on provideing metrics and health checks in a performant purely functional manner.

* Comprehensive and consistent
* Type safe, purely-functional
* Pluggable effect monads
* Asynchronous and non-blocking
* Supports streaming
* Can be used in Scala REPLs

If it can affect your code's business value, measure it. -- Coda Hale

In order to know how well our *code* is generating *business value*, we need *metrics* -- also Coda Hale
